# Password-Generator-Saver
Easy and simple software for generating passwords and storing them in a json file!

After clicking in the 'Add' button it will create a new json file with all the information stored.
It allows us to search if an account does exist or not by clicking on the Search button.

I need testing & feedback with the executable file!
