# Password-Generator-Saver

Easy and simple software for generating passwords and storing them in a json file!

After clicking in the 'Add' button it will create a new json file with all the information stored.
It allows us to search if an account does exist or not by clicking on the Search button.

I need testing & feedback with the executable file!

If you don't trust this executable but want to try it out anyway you can run the python file yourself:  

1) Install python, see how in:  [https://www.python.org/downloads/]

2) Open the folder with the cmd and type: **pip install pyperclip**

3) Run it

This is how it looks:

>[!NOTE]
>When using the search function you won't be able to copy the data from the window (in case you want to paste somewhere)
